<h1>Hello</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Include your name, student number, student email address, picture, and some basic background information
nationality and culture, education to date, languages spoken etc). Include at least one fact about yourself that others
may find interesting, such as a hobby, a pet or your favourite sport or other pastime.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length.
<br>• What is your interest in IT?
<br>• When did your interest in IT start?
<br>• Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
<br>• Outline your IT experience (if any).
<br>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
<br>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?
 </p>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>Find an advertisement showing what you believe to be your ideal job. This may require several years of experience,
and hence be something that you must work towards, rather than something that you are ready for now, or will be
able to fill as soon as you graduate.

<br>There are various ways to search for IT jobs, including websites like {seek.com.au}. You should include the following
information.

<br>• The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link expires before the
assignment deadline).
<br>• A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
<br>• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
<br>• A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
<br>• A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,
building on those you have now.
<br>This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly
over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can. </p>
